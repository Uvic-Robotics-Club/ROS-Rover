# Hardware accelerated decoding (available only for FFMPEG-decoded pixel formats, especially for h264)
    # The feature is supported only from libavcodec 52.00.100 built with --enable-vdpau --enable-cuvid --enable-nvenc or
    # --enable-cuda options or any other options activating HWACCEL API like --enable-libdrm. 
    # The exact list of the available hardware accelerators can be printed with command:
    # ffmpeg -hwaccels
    # then the obtained names would be used to activate the decoder.
    # Known accelerators:
    # - cuda - for any kind of CUDA/NVENC nVidia-powered accelerators
    # - vdpau - libvdpau, nVidia PureVideo HD or AMD VCE on selected devices (mostly incompatible with 
    #   modern H.264 hardware encoders, but decodes almost any flavour of MotionJPEG streams)
    # - drm - libdrm, Direct Object Rendering on ARM Mali GPUs supporting OpenCL
    # - nvdec - nVidia Codec SDK for AV1 on compatible GPU
    # - dxva2 - DirectX Video Accelerator API for Windows
    # - vaapi - Intel QuickSync or AMD UVD/VCE decoder on compatible Intel chipsets or AMD Radeon GPUs
    # If the desired accelerated decoder is not available or FFMPEG does not respond correctly on the activation request,
    # the node falls back automatically to the default software decoder.
